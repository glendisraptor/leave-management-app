Here’s a **README.md** template for running a Vite React application:

# Leave Management System MVP - React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a **Vite**-powered React application. Vite is a fast and optimized build tool for modern web development. This README will guide you on how to set up and run the application locally.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 16 or higher. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js, but if you need to install it separately, use the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g npm
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   Change into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   Install the necessary dependencies using npm (or yarn, if preferred):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

1. **Start the development server**:

   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start Vite in development mode. By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

2. **Access the application**:

   Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see the application in action.

## Building the Application

To build the application for production:

1. **Build the application**:

   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

2. **Preview the production build**:

   After building, you can preview the production build by running:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   This will start a local server to preview the production version of the app.

## Environment Variables

To configure the application with your own settings (e.g., API keys, URLs), you may need to add environment variables.

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project if it doesn't exist already.

2. **Add variables** as needed, for example:
   ```bash
   VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
   VITE_APP_NAME=MyApp
   ```

   Vite automatically exposes any environment variable starting with `VITE_` to the client-side JavaScript.
